# Deep Funding üå±

Exploring fair open-source dependency tree funding allocation by using AI models to allocate weights and validating results with human spot-checking.

## üéØ Why Deep Funding?

Traditional public goods funding faces scaling challenges:
- Funders must evaluate each project individually
- Large-group funding leads to public campaigning
- Small-group funding creates favoritism and limited scale

Deep Funding solves this through:
1. Value as a graph: Instead of abstract "value to humanity", we measure relative contributions between dependencies
2. Distilled human judgment: An open market of AI models allocates weights, validated by random human spot-checks

This creates a scalable, efficient system that can handle millions of dependencies while maintaining human oversight. It avoids difficult abstract questions about absolute value and instead focuses on concrete, local comparisons ("compare A and B's direct impact on C"). Also creates an open market for allocation models that can scale beyond a small number of projects.

## üìä Evaluation

The cost function measures how well a model's predictions align with human judgments. For each triple `{A, B, C}` where a judge says "A contributes X times more than B to C", we compute:

- Simple version: `cost = (A/B - X)^2`
- Symmetric version: `cost = ((A/sqrt(X) - B*sqrt(X))/(A + B))^2`

A human jury performs detailed analysis on randomly selected edges. Only a small fraction of predictions are actually validated by humans. Models that consistently align with human judgments earn higher weights. This creates a fast, cheap, and credibly neutral mechanism that mirrors trustworthy human judgment.

The jury will evaluate:

1. Replaceability: How much time has the dependency saved you?
2. Specificity: Is the dependency specific to EVM or a general building block like aes or hashes/nobles
3. Additionality: Is the dependency already well funded?

## üöÄ Quickstart

Make sure you have [`uv` installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Then run the following command to install the dependencies.

```bash
uv sync
```

### üîê Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Path to a Google Cloud service account with BigQuery access. You can create one on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) and store it under an `env` folder.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A GitHub personal access token with rate limiting. You can create one on [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
